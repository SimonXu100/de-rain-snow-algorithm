### Research on Content-adaptive Rain and Snow Removal Algorithms for Single Image Using Bilateral Filtering and Guided Filtering
Advisor: Dr. Xinwei Xue

Calculated the prior (saliency map of original image) image, divided the image into regions by the method of clustering based on a prior value (saliency value) and applied different regions with different bilateral filtering coefficients, which improved the effect of removing rain and snow and reduce the influence of fuzzification

Established a mathematical modeling using the characteristics of rain and snow of white and shiny, eliminated the influence of rain and snow through image calculation and used it as a guidance image for guiding filtering, which improved traditional guided filtering

Completed to collect related literature, code integration and algorithm programming
